## Detection-of-Text-Written-in-air
Our project involves the recognition of one single digit that is written on the air. To achieve this, we have adopted a deep learning-based approach. The model adopted is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is most commonly used in the analyses of visual imagery. With this project, we got an accuracy of 98% on the MNIST dataset.
Analyzing the code step by step can make you understand the exact working & process followed.
